	<h1>Summary</h1>

	<p><strong><abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">tl;dr</abbr></strong>:

	  Dowse is free software dedicated to enhancing the
	  conviviality of your online networking experience, and your
	  peace of mind.  Preserving your privacy is part of this
	  mission.  <strong>Dowse will never spy on you nor disclose
	  your network information to anyone.</strong></p>

	<h1>Privacy by Design</h1>

	<p>Dyne:dowse
	is <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"
	class="extref">free software</a>.  It follows the principle
	of <strong>privacy by design</strong>: that means the
	developers care about the your freedom, and protecting your
	privacy.</p>

	<p>The objective of Dowse is to put you in control of your own
	network, and protect your privacy from prying eyes, from
	advertisers on the Web, to your ISP, or rogue devices on your
	local network.</p>

	<p>Dowse does not, and will never provide any information on
	your local network to third parties, including to Dowse
	developers and partners.  Your network is yours, and your
	privacy is critical to the success of our products.  There is
	not, however, any security measure that will prevent a
	determined individual from voluntarily leaking information
	from within your network to a third party.  Our promise is
	that if such an attempt is detected, Dowse will tell you, and
	if there is a way to prevent it, Dowse will implement it in
	the best of our developers' abilities.</p>

	<h1>Network Monitoring</h1>

	<p>In order to manage devices and provide safe networking
	conditions on your network, Dowse is monitoring connecting
	devices, and make them visible to the administrators of the
	Dowse appliance.</p>

	<p>Identifying information such as the MAC address, and other
	device information is used by Dowse to provide services, such
	as selective connectivity to unknown devices, or plain
	rejection of unwanted devices.  This information is stored on
	the Dowse appliance.</p>

	<p>No information about your network needs to be sent beyond
	it, so Dowse is not sending anything about it outside of your
	local network.</p>

	</nav>
	<h1>Data Storage</h1>

	<p>Privacy-sensitive data is stored on the Dowse device.  The
	storage is NOT YET made on encrypted filesystem, so we
	recommend that you encrypt your filesystem prior to installing
	Dowse software.</p>

	<p>Dowse keeps information about known devices, but never
	communicates that data to anyone but you.  When it is
	implemented, you can use the RESET button to empty the
	database and restart the Dowse system.  It will recreate its
	database and populate it with the devices it detects when it
	starts.</p>

	</nav>
	<h1>Remote Access</h1>

	<p>You can choose to enable upgrade detection: Dowse will
	connect to the <strong>dowse.equipment</strong> service over
	Tor to retrieve information about an eventual new release.
	You should always use your operating system's package manager
	to perform upgrades.  Dowse does not provide automated
	upgrades besides that of the operating system.</p>

	<p>The Dowse appliance is accessible via this Web interface,
	but only from the local network.  Privacy-sensitive operations
	require administrative control, which can be setup using the
	pairing mechanism upon installation.  Once this step has been
	performed, further devices can be authorized by existing
	administrators.</p>

	<p>All Dowse configuration, including accessible via this Web
	interface, are done via the Dowse API.  All operations require
	authentication and authorization from known local clients.</p>

	<p>Dowse does not offer any access from outside the LAN.</p>

	<p>Some modules might provide extra services, e.g., to enable
	a Tor relay, or an SSH tunnel: use them with care.  Such
	modules are labeled appropriately.</p>

	<h1>Privacy Policy Updates</h1>

	<p>Policy updates will happen via release upgrades.  They will
	not change to rip you off your privacy, because we're not a
	corporation, we're not a government, we're not looking to be
	bought by a corporation, and you're not for sale.  Dowse is a
	free software project dedicated to protect your privacy, and
	this point will never change.</p>

	<p><strong>Canary:</strong> Dowse developers were not
	contacted by any secret services, or prying systems that may
	be able to legally silence us.  We were not told to introduce
	a backdoor in our software, track our users, nor do anything
	susceptible to affect you.  We're clear from evil.</p>
