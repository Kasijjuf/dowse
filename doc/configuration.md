# Dowse Configuration

To properly configure Dowse, we suggest to keep in mind the role of any configuration file.

They are:
* `/etc/dowse/settings`
* `/etc/dowse/network?`


## /etc/dowse/settings

In this file you can configure all parameter that characterize the Dowse box, to instance the value you should use the typical syntax "`<em>key</em>=<em>value</em>` and the hash `#` to comment .

The parameter more frequently configured are :
- interface
- address
- dowse_net
- dowse_guests
- wan (it's the network interface that expose the internet (ie: the cable to you adsl modem-router )
- dns
