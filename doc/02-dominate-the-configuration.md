cd# Dowse Configuration

To properly configure Dowse, we suggest to keep in mind the role of any configuration file.

They are:
* `/etc/dowse/settings`
* `/etc/dowse/network`

## /etc/dowse/settings

In this file you can configure all parameter that characterize the Dowse box, to instance the value you should use the typical syntax *key=value* and the hash `#` to comment .

The parameter more frequently configured are :
- _interface_ : it's the network interface to expose the internal dowse network.
- _address_ : it's the dowse host address.
- *dowse_net* : it's the dowse network mask.
- *dowse_guests* : it's DHCP server parameter to distribute the address (it's expressed in the form _start address_,_end address_,_lease time_.
- _wan_ : it's the network address behing to masquerade the network.
- *internet_interface* : it's the network interface should be routed to provide internet access.
- _dns_ : it's the external DNS providing dns query resolution services.
